# Professional Experience

### Postdoctoral Research Scientist

**Imperial College London** - London, England, UK - September 2021 to Present

I am currently doing postdoctoral work in <a href="https://beneuro.ic.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Juan Gallego's group</a> at Imperial College London, where I am involved in experimental and data science projects related to neurotechnology and motor control. This work involves:

* Developing Python data preprocessing, visualization, analysis and decoding pipelines to understand relationships between populations of neurons and kinematics.

* Validating a novel ÂµECoG array in a terminal mouse model.

* Establishing mouse electrophysiology procedures, including designing experiments, animal colony management, generating experimental and surgical SOPs, neural data collection, training lab personnel, and building relationships with veterinary and support staff.

* Writing a perspective on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438824000059" target="_blank">isolating the functional contributions of individual brain regions in motor control</a>.

* Mentoring trainees on data analysis projects using machine learning techniques to investigate relationships between neural signals and behaviour.

### Doctoral Research Scientist

**Dartmouth College** - Hanover, New Hampshire, USA - 2015 to 2021

I completed my PhD at Dartmouth College in the lab of <a href="http://www.vandermeerlab.org/" target="_blank">Matthijs van der Meer</a> where I sought to integrate classical notions of the nucleus accumbens as a value- and motivation-centric region, with more contemporary evidence suggesting a role in certain aspects of behavioural flexibility. I started this work at the University of Waterloo in 2013 before moving to Darmouth in 2015. Some of my work experience includes:

* Designing, collecting, analyzing, and interpreting 3 primary datasets consisting of extracellular electrophysiological recordings during performance of <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37275" target="_blank">freely-moving (rats)</a> or <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001338" target="_blank">head-fixed (mice)</a> behaviours.

* Data collection for various projects involving managing animal colonies, setting up experimental hardware, establishing behavioural tasks, writing Matlab scripts for experiment control, building and implanting electrode arrays, acquiring simultaneous behavioural and electrophysiology data, and performing histology on brain tissue.

* Data processing of various neural datasets in Matlab, including spike sorting, artifact detection in spiking and local field potential data, and filtering local field potentials into frequency bands of interest.

* Cross-validated data analysis of various datasets in Matlab, including relating neural activity to behaviour with <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37275" target="_blank">z-scores, t-tests, linear regressions, GLMs, LDA, </a> <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001338" target="_blank">binomial regressions, and demixed PCA</a>; relating oscillatory activity to spiking activity with spike-field metrics such as <a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/1178c64cfc02ef12989bee1bfc0953ad/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y" target="_blank">spike-triggered spectrum and pairwise-phase consistency</a>; and comparing all analyses to shuffled versions of the data.

* Disseminating research findings to the broader scientific community via writing manuscripts for peer-reviewed publications and presenting posters at professional conferences.

* Assisting in the <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/33/7962.abstract" target="_blank">data collection of local field potentials</a> and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/617233v1.abstract" target="_blank">spike-field analysis</a> of 2 other datasets.

* Mentoring undergraduate students on animal behaviour, and on using Matlab for both experimental control and extracting task-related neural activity.

* Leading laboratory sections for a senior undergraduate systems neuroscience course, focusing on understanding neural circuits via sheep brain dissections, and animal behaviour via various behavioural assays.

* Data collection and student training for a pilot experiment integrating extracellular recordings and fiber photometry, as part of assisting the 2019 mouse striatum module of the Marine Biological Laboratory's Neural Systems and Behavior course. 

### Research Scientist

**Wilfrid Laurier University** - Waterloo, Ontario, Canada - 2009 to 2013

I started my research career with <a href="https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/faculty-of-science/faculty-profiles/bruce-mckay/index.html" target="_blank">Bruce McKay</a> at Wilfrid Laurier University where I completed my BSc and MSc theses. Here, I investigated the effects of the abused solvent toluene on various aspects of neural function. I was involved in a number of projects, including:

* Designing, collecting, analysing, and interpreting (SPSS, Excel) data for a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394013010835" target="_blank">patch clamp electrophysiology experiment</a>, an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0892036212000542" target="_blank">extracellular electrophysiology experiment</a>, and a <a href="https://journals.lww.com/behaviouralpharm/Abstract/2012/10000/Binge_inhalation_of_toluene_vapor_produces.4.aspx" target="_blank">behavioural pharmacology experiment</a> in rats. 

* Assisting tissue processing for an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0892036211002066" target="_blank">immediate early gene histology experiment</a>.
