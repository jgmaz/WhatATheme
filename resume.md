# Professional Experience

### Research Associate

**Imperial College London** - London, England, UK - September 2021 to Present

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher in <a href="https://beneuro.ic.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Juan Gallego's group</a>, where I am currently running an experiment focused on understanding circuit-wide contributions to feedback-mediated motor. In addition, I am involved in the experimental validation team for a novel neural interface, as well as working on a data science project seeking to understand how population-level communication between regions is dependent upon task state.

### PhD Candidate

**Dartmouth College** - Hanover, New Hampshire, USA - 2015 to 2021

I completed my PhD at Dartmouth in the lab of <a href="http://www.vandermeerlab.org/" target="_blank">Matthijs van der Meer</a> where I sought to integrate classical notions of the nucleus accumbens as a value- and motivation-centric region, with more contemporary evidence suggesting a role in certain aspects of behavioural flexibility. I started this work at the University of Waterloo in 2013 before moving to Darmouth in 2015. Some of my work experience includes:

* Data processing of various neural datasets in Matlab, including spike sorting, artifact detection in spiking and local field potential data, and filtering of local field potentials into frequency bands of interest.

* Cross-validated data analysis of various datasets in Matlab, including relating neural activity to behaviour with <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37275" target="_blank">z-scores, t-tests, linear regressions</a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001338" target="_blank">binomial regressions, and demixed PCA</a>; relating oscillatory activity to spiking activity with spike-field metrics such as <a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/1178c64cfc02ef12989bee1bfc0953ad/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y" target="_blank">spike-triggered spectrum and pairwise-phase consistency</a>; and comparing all analyses to shuffled versions of the data.

* Designing, piloting, and collecting 3 primary datasets consisting of extracellular electrophysiological recordings during performance of <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37275" target="_blank">freely-moving (rats)</a> or <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001338" target="_blank">head-fixed (mice)</a> behaviours.

* Assisting in the <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/33/7962.abstract" target="_blank">data collection of local field potentials</a> and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/617233v1.abstract" target="_blank">spike-field analysis</a> of 2 other datasets.

* Mentoring undergraduate students on animal behaviour and using Matlab for experimental control, and extracting task-related neural activity.

* Data collection and student training for a pilot experiment integrating extracellular recordings and fiber photometry, as part of assisting the 2020 mouse striatum module of the Wood's Hole Neural Systems and Behavior course. 

### Undergraduate & Graduate Research Assistant

**Wilfrid Laurier University** - Waterloo, Ontario, Canada - 2009 to 2013

I started my research career with <a href="https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/faculty-of-science/faculty-profiles/bruce-mckay/index.html" target="_blank">Bruce McKay</a> at Wilfrid Laurier University where I completed my BSc and MSc theses. Here, I investigated the effects of the abused solvent toluene on various aspects of neural function. I was involved in a number of projects, including:

* Designing, collecting, and analysing (SPSS, Excel) data for a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394013010835" target="_blank">patch clamp electrophysiology experiment</a>, an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0892036212000542" target="_blank">extracellular electrophysiology experiment</a>, and a <a href="https://journals.lww.com/behaviouralpharm/Abstract/2012/10000/Binge_inhalation_of_toluene_vapor_produces.4.aspx" target="_blank">behavioural experiment</a> in rats. 


* Assisting tissue processing for an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0892036211002066" target="_blank">immediate early gene histology experiment</a>.
